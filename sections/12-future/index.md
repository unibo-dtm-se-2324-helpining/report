# Known issues and future work

This section describes what is missing, what does not work as it should, and potential future developments to improve or expand the software.

## What is Missing

1. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - More unit tests and integration tests are needed to ensure the reliability and stability of the application.
   - Automated end-to-end testing to cover user scenarios is currently lacking.

## Potential Future Developments

1. **Mobile Application**:
   - Developing native mobile applications for both iOS and Android to provide a more seamless experience for mobile users.

2. **Integration with Other Tools**:
   - Integrating with other collaboration tools and platforms, such as Slack or Zoom, to offer more options for communication between users and experts.

3. **Real-time Notifications**:
   - Notifications for users and experts now are only emails and will be app notifications, which can affect user experience.
