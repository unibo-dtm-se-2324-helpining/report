# Development

## DVCS

The development process of my Helpining project adheres to a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) model to streamline collaboration, ensure code quality, and facilitate continuous integration. This section delves into the conventions we have established for branch usage, commit practices, and other relevant aspects.

### Branch Usage Conventions

My branching strategy is designed to maximize efficiency and minimize risks associated with code integration. We utilize two primary branches: `dev` and `main`.

- **main**: The `main` branch serves as the backbone of my project. It is the production-ready branch, representing the most stable and thoroughly tested codebase. Merging into `main` signifies that the changes have undergone rigorous testing and review processes, ensuring that only the quality code reaches production environment. This branch is protected, requiring pull requests which are the alignment requests from the branch concerned to the programmer's computer.

- **dev**: The `dev` branch is the active development branch where all new features and bug fixes are initially integrated. By isolating development work from the production code, we can iterate rapidly without compromising the stability of the `main` branch. This approach allows developers to experiment and refine their code until it is stable enough to be merged into `main`.

### Commit Conventions

Commit messages play a critical role in the clarity and maintainability of my project. We enforce a strict convention to ensure that every commit is meaningful and traceable.

- **Conciseness and Descriptiveness**: Each commit message should succinctly describe the changes made.
  
- **Format**: Use the present and imperative mood for commit messages (Add, Update, Delete). This style conveys that a commit applies changes as of the moment of writing, providing a more direct and active tone. For example, use "Add user authentication feature".

- **Structure**: Start with a capital letter and avoid ending with a period.

### Additional Relevant Aspects

- **Branch Protection and Code Reviews**: Protecting the `main` branch by enforcing mandatory pull requests ensures that all changes are subject to peer review. This process is crucial for maintaining code quality and fostering a collaborative development environment. Peer reviews help identify potential issues early, provide opportunities for knowledge sharing, and enhance overall code quality.

- **Documentation and Code Comments**: Maintaining thorough documentation and code comments is a fundamental aspect of my development process. Clear documentation facilitates easier onboarding of new developers and enhances the maintainability of the codebase. Comments within the code should explain the 'why' behind complex logic, providing context that goes beyond the 'what' that is evident from the code itself.
