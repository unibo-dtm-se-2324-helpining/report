# Validation

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
    - Unit tests were created for individual components and functions to ensure they work as expected in isolation. These tests focused on:
        - **Backend:** Testing individual FastAPI endpoints and data processing functions.
        - **Frontend:** Testing Vue components, ensuring they render correctly and handle state changes properly.
- **Integration Tests:**
    - Integration tests were conducted to verify the interaction between different parts of the application. These tests focused on:
        - Ensuring that the frontend and backend communicate correctly.
        - Testing database interactions and ensuring data consistency.
- **Functional Tests:**
    - Functional tests evaluated the applicationâ€™s functionality by simulating user actions. These tests included:
        - Simulating user workflows such as login, data submission, and profile updates.
        - Verifying that user requests are correctly processed and handled by the system.
- **Coverage:**
    - I used Coverage.py measures code coverage, during test execution. It uses the code analysis tools and tracing hooks provided in the Python standard library to determine which lines are executable, and which have been executed.

## Acceptance Test

- **Describe the Acceptance Tests:**
    - **Upload Help Request:** Verified that users can upload help requests and that these requests are correctly stored and retrievable.
    - **Accept User Help Request:** Ensured that experts can view and accept help requests, with proper updates in the system.
    - **Update Personal Profile:** Tested the functionality for users and experts to update their profiles, ensuring data consistency and validation.
    - **Select Expert for Resolving Help Request:** Checked the selection process for users to choose an expert, ensuring the system correctly matches, assigns experts, creates and send mail to experts for call Teams meeting.
    - **Rate the Assistance:** Verified that users can rate the assistance they received, and that these ratings are stored and reflected in expert profiles.
- **Comments on Requirements' Acceptance Criteria:**
    - The acceptance tests confirmed that the application meets all the defined requirements. Each requirement was translated into one or more test cases, ensuring comprehensive coverage. Any deviations identified during testing were addressed, and the final application version satisfies all acceptance criteria.
