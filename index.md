## Abstract

'Helpining' is set to disrupt the conventional methods of seeking expert assistance by offering a web application that connects users with specialists in real-time across fields like engineering, economics, mathematics, and law. The necessity for immediate access to expertise consultancy and 'Helpining' addresses this need.

Traditional approaches to finding expert helpâ€”be it through consulting firms, online forums, or professional networks outdated and often inefficient. They involve unnecessary delays, high costs, and unreliable outcomes. 'Helpining' challenges these norms by providing a streamlined, secure platform that ensures users receive immediate, reliable solutions from verified experts.

The use of JWT-based authorization ensures that the platform is secure, protecting user data and maintaining the integrity of expert consultations. This robust security measure builds trust and reliability, which are crucial for any advisory service. The intuitive profile management system allows users and experts to keep their information updated, ensuring relevance and accuracy, which is vital for maintaining a high standard of service. By enabling experts to view and select user requests relevant to their expertise, 'Helpining' ensures that problems are addressed by the most qualified individuals, enhancing the likelihood of effective solutions. Upon selecting an expert, the platform instantly sends an email with a link to a video call, facilitating immediate, direct communication. This eliminates the delays and miscommunications typical of traditional consultation methods.

'Helpining' is not just a web application; it is a paradigm shift in how we approach problem-solving. By leveraging cutting-edge technology and focusing on user experience, it challenges the inefficiencies of traditional methods and sets a new standard for accessing expert assistance. This project exemplifies how modern solutions can overcome the limitations of outdated practices, delivering greater efficiency, reliability, and satisfaction.
